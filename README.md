# Antlr Demo

## About

A demo project for `Antlr`

## FYI

  * Grammar files should be placed in [src/main/antlr](src/main/antlr)
  * The package of the generated parser and lexer should be given in the generation option ([build.gradle.kts](build.gradle.kts))
  * Generated source files are generated in build/generated-src
  * Idea will then mark the generated directory as `source root`
